1. Prepare the Android development environment with
	- Android Studio 2.2.2
	- Android SDK
	- Android API 25
	- Android SDK Tools 25
	- Tested with a Sumsung Galaxy Note 5 - Android 5.1.1

2. To Start project
	- Import the project with Android Studio 2.2.2
	- Click on Sync Project with Gradle Files
	- Run Project

3. I assume that the app (as you asked) it's going to have more modules so I add a Navigation Drawer with some options, but the Map one is active.

4. The rest services did not have a HOST variable so I had to add it. The problem was that when I runned the backend was on localhost so my Android app did not get to it.
